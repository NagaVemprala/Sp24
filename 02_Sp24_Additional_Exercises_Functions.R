#> Coding task 1: Summarize Species Data (iris dataset)
#> Hint: Use summary function and interpret results. No need to create a separate function.
#> Instead use the existing ones such as summary, str, head to understand the data. ----


#> Coding task 2: Create a function that takes a species name as input and returns a summary of 
#> its Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, and Petal.Width in the iris dataset, 
#> including mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles. Make sure that the 
#> summary statistic is only for a single flower. Therefore, you should do a subset 
#> option based on the type of flower passed as input argument to the function.
#> ----

#> Coding task 3: Find Outliers (mtcars dataset)
#> Create a function that takes a column name from the mtcars dataset as input 
#> and identifies outliers using interquartile range (IQR) method, returning a list of outlier values.
#> Capture the return values into another variable and display it after creating the variable to hold 
#> return values.


#> Coding task 4: Visualize Correlations (mtcars dataset)
#> Create a function that visualizes pairwise correlations between all numeric variables 
#> in the mtcars dataset using separate scatter plots, with appropriate labels for x and y, and 
#> plot colors. If possible explore the mfrow() option while creating plots in base R.

#> Coding task 5: Generate Descriptive Statistics Report (any dataset)
#> The dataset name should be passed as a text value in the argument. Create a function 
#> that generates a comprehensive descriptive statistics report for any given dataset, 
#> including measures of central tendency, dispersion, distribution shape, and missing values.
#> Hint: You can use the get() function to treat the string value as a variable name.
#> Pass the dataset name in lower case as input to the function as a string, so that it can
#> be extracted using a get("string passed") to use the value as a dataset itself inside 
#> function body.
